# OBJECT DETECTION IN IMAGES USING YOLOV3 ALGORITHM

This project is a part of my second research work on “Real-Time Detection and Recognition of traffic signs in Bangladesh using YOLOv3 Detector”. Before getting started on that research, I had to learn the basics of computer vision algorithms and how they work. I studied several algorithms and found that YOLOv3 is the latest and faster than any other algorithm till now. So, the primary step I took before conducting the research is building this project to detect objects in images using the YOLOv3 algorithm. I used Keras library to build the YOLOv3 model from scratch and loaded it with a pre-trained weight file. Then I used both Keras and TensorFlow to load the model and detect several classified objects in images.

YOLOv3 is now highly used widely for computer vision projects because of its speed and lightweight model. I have continued my exploration in the field of Computer Vision using YOLOv3. The further improvement of this for my research work is to train the model with my team’s custom-made dataset and then run a test accordingly.
